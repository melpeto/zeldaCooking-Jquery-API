## Link's Kitchen: A Cooking Resource for _Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_

jQuery | HTML5 | CSS3 | RESTful API <br>

In _Breath of the Wild_, certain items can be added as ingredients to a Cooking Pot. Each ingredient carries specific effects that are applied Link's food when it is cooked. Choose your desired effect from the list to see all the ingredients which will lend that effect to your dish. <br> 

Uses Ajax to access a RESTful API, and the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM. <br>

### Next Steps

- The visual design of this page coud use some love :wink:. This was the culmination of learning jQuery, so I was focused more on the Javascript (ES6) than on the overall design
- Error handling
- Add more data from the API, like 'common locations' or 'hearts recovered'
